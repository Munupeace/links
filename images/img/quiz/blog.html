      <p>WATER POLLUTION.
        Water pollution, the release of substances into subsurface groundwateror into lakes,streams,rivers,estuaries and oceans to the point where the substances interfere with beneficial use of the water or with the natural functioning of ecosystems. In addition to the release of substances,such as chemicals or microorganisms,water pollution may also include the release of energy, in the form of radioactivity or heat, into bodies of water.
        water bodies can be polluted by a wide variety of substances,including pathogenic microorganisms,putrescible organic waste, plant nutrients,toxic chemicals,sediments,heat,petroleum, and radioactive substances.Biological pollutants that constitute a significant part of drinking water contamination can be divided into three categories.microorganisms,natural organic matter,biological toxinse.g cyanobacterialtoxins appearing in a treatment plant because of the presence of a specific microorganism, they are lysed during the treatment process and then they release toxins.
        Diseases caused by bacteria,viruses and protozoa found in water are among the most ommon risks for humans and animals. such infections may be caused by pathogenic organisms with improperlytreated water.</p>

        Farming aquatic animals occurs in both the inland freshwaters and the saline coastal waters of Thailand. The animals raised includes finfish,shrimps and prawns and oysters, mussels and cockles.The main fish and fishery products exported by Thailand are shrimp,canned seafood, fish and squid.
          Thailand accounts for the majority of shrimp imported to the united states and its system is rife with human rights abuses. In 2020, the total export value of shrimp are drained and packed in ice in shallow boxes. the time between catching and chilling must be short. A delay of an hour or so on a warm day can cause considerable spoilage. The box should be not more than about 200mm deep to avoid crushing the bottom shrimp.</p>

        <p>AQUACULTURE
          Aquaculture is the beneficial and sustainable use of water as a medium to farm organisms, such as finfish, shellfish,and aquatic plants. Aquaculture, the farming of aquatic organisms, including fish, molluscs, crustaceans and aquatic plants,is often cited as one of the means of efficiently increasing food production in food-deficit countries;and improving livelihood and poverty status among farming households. From ancient times,fishing has been a major source of food for humanity aand a provider of employment and economic benefits to those engaged in this activity.
         Fish has always been an important source of protein in the human diet and on global scale, fish and fish products are the most important source of protein and its estimated that more than 30% of fish for human consumptions comes from aquaculture.Over the past three decades, aquaculture has developed to become the fastest growing food-producing sector in the world. A large proportion of fish products come from small-scale producers in developind countries. More than 80% of global aquaculture products are produced in fresh water.</p>
